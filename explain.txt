Back-end - server side.
we have used firebase
    Firebase is a Backend-as-a-Service — BaaS on google cloud paltform
    don’t need to manage servers,
          athentication
          data storage
          file storge
          hosting
 what we have done on firebase
          created project, add app , enable hosting, enable google authentication ( we can use multiple-facebook, tweeter,github,etc)
          created data base with firestore
          add three collection (userd, admin and notice)
          Modifide rules for that
          user -any budy can write after login with their gmail
          admin- only owner can write, every budy can read(owner means email which is used for creating firebase account)
          notice -only admin can write,
    there are main for things requird for any data base -CRUD-create, read, update and delete
    depanding on your signin email you can do that things
    for administration of daily activity there are two role-user and admin
    admin can do all three things- cru , can not delete
    Admin can not write in user collection. 
    user can only read notice and can read /wrte their profile in user collection
    so basically in user any buddy can read all data and write their own data
    
    Notice -fields- 
    dept, 
    title 
    displayon=true or false
    body/matter 
    following fields created/edited automatic
